# Python-Integration-for-.Net
A simple cut down python install with pythonnet and a few functions to make some things easier.
Made by someone who has no idea what they are doing. It is probably broken and stupid on many levels.
It works for me t on windows though Linux Does not however that being said It is probably the way I set up the interpreter...
Another thing is you still probably want to link pythonnet's System.Runtime.DLL anyway.
