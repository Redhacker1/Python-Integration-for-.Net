# Python-Integration-for-.Net
A simple cut down python install with pythonnet and a few functions to make some things easier.
Made by someone who has no idea what they are doing. It is probably broken and stupid on many levels.
One of the ways it is not working is an issue, Linux support... Windows works just fine for me.
Another thing is you still probably want to link pythonnet's System.Runtime.DLL anyway.
